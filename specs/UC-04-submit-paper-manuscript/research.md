# Phase 0 Research: Submit Paper Manuscript

## Decision: Supported file formats are PDF and DOCX

**Rationale**: Selected to balance common conference formats and validation
simplicity.

**Alternatives considered**: PDF only; PDF/DOCX/LaTeX.

## Decision: Maximum file size is 20 MB

**Rationale**: Suitable for typical manuscript sizes without excessive storage
costs.

**Alternatives considered**: 10 MB or 50 MB.

## Decision: File upload failures block submission

**Rationale**: Metadata and file must be stored together; if file upload fails,
submission must not complete.

**Alternatives considered**: Save metadata draft only or retry later.
