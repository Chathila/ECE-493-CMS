# Submission Quality Checklist: Submit Paper Manuscript

**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for the submission feature.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full submission flow from entry
  point to dashboard redirect? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-012]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all validation failure scenarios covered by explicit
  requirements (missing metadata, invalid metadata, unsupported format, oversized
  file)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005..FR-015]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for file upload failures and the
  user-facing error response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-016]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for storing metadata and the manuscript file
  together? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009..FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Are supported file formats explicitly listed in requirements or
  referenced to policy? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the maximum file size specified or referenced to policy?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-008, §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK007 Are "invalid metadata" rules defined with specific formatting
  expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 Are required metadata fields fully enumerated without ambiguity?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Do success criteria time thresholds align with stated UX expectations
  in user stories? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-006]
- [ ] CHK010 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-016]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-006]
- [ ] CHK012 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all represented with
  explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-016]
- [ ] CHK014 Are file validation scenarios described consistently across
  requirements and acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3,
  §FR-007..FR-015]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements defined for author abandonment of a partially
  completed submission? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for submission page load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK017 Are requirements defined for storage service outages during upload?
  [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-016]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK018 Are performance targets for validation feedback and confirmation
  timing explicitly defined and measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005, §SC-006]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK019 Are assumptions about submission period status and enforcement
  explicit and traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK020 Are assumptions about file format and size policy explicit and
  traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, §Clarifications]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK021 Are vague terms ("invalid metadata", "clear error message") quantified
  or scoped to avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006,
  §FR-013]
