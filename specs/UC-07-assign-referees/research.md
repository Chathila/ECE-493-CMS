# Phase 0 Research: Assign Referees to Submitted Papers

## Decision: Minimum of one referee per paper

**Rationale**: Use case implies at least one referee and SRS does not specify a higher minimum.

**Alternatives considered**: Minimum of two or three referees.

## Decision: No maximum referee count enforced

**Rationale**: SRS does not define a max; allow more than one without a cap.

**Alternatives considered**: Maximum of three or four.

## Decision: Notification failures do not block assignments

**Rationale**: Assignments should persist even if notifications fail; warn editor.

**Alternatives considered**: Block assignment or retry-only.
