**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for referee assignment.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full assignment flow from selection
  to notification? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all failure scenarios covered (invalid email, workload limits,
  too few referees, notification failure)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-012]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is the minimum referee requirement explicitly stated?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Are workload limits defined or referenced to policy?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are warning vs error behaviors for notification failure explicit?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 Do user stories and requirements align on minimum referee count?
  [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK007 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-012]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows represented with explicit
  requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-012]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for assignment page load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK012 Are assumptions about workload limits and referee limits explicit
  and traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK013 Are vague terms ("clear error message") scoped to avoid subjective
  interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009..FR-011]
