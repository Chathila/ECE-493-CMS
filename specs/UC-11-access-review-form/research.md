# Phase 0 Research: Access Paper Review Form

## Decision: Invitation not accepted is treated as unauthorized

**Rationale**: Use case preconditions require invitation acceptance; access
should be denied when not accepted.

**Alternatives considered**: Allow access with warning; allow access without
acceptance.

## Decision: Access denied is shown on the form page

**Rationale**: Clarified behavior specifies access-denied messaging on the form
page and no form loading.

**Alternatives considered**: Redirect to dashboard with banner.

## Decision: Form unavailable message has no additional guidance

**Rationale**: Clarified requirement specifies a simple unavailable message.

**Alternatives considered**: Include retry guidance or support contact.
