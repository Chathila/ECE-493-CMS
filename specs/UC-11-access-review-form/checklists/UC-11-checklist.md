## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all three user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for authorization checks before form display? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for successful retrieval and display of form and paper details? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for access-denied behavior including messaging and no form load? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for form-unavailable errors with specified message content? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the authorization rule (assigned + accepted) unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "form unavailable" message content explicitly constrained? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the access-denied presentation location clearly specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the success condition for display of form and paper details unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do edge cases match functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK011 Do assumptions align with the authorization requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with the access-denied and unavailable behaviors? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004..FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria map to requirements (authorized access, denial, retrieval failure)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003, Spec §FR-001..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary access flows fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK017 Are unauthorized access flows covered for both unassigned and not-accepted cases? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK018 Are retrieval failure flows covered in both scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are database/system error cases explicitly tied to form-unavailable behavior? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are any response-time expectations specified for loading the form? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK022 Are security/privacy requirements for form access specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are dependencies on authorization service and assignment status documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 Are assumptions about invitation acceptance explicitly referenced in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §FR-008]
