# Phase 0 Research: Accept or Reject Review Invitation

## Decision: Single response per invitation

**Rationale**: Prevents conflicting assignment decisions and matches clarified
rule that the first response locks the invitation.

**Alternatives considered**: Allow response changes until expiry; editor
approval for changes.

## Decision: Expired invitations block access

**Rationale**: Avoids misleading UI and prevents submission of invalid
responses.

**Alternatives considered**: Allow viewing but block submission.

## Decision: Editor notifications include decision only

**Rationale**: Clarified requirement specifies only accept/reject in
notifications.

**Alternatives considered**: Include referee identity and paper details.
