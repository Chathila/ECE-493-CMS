# Phase 0 Research: Receive Final Paper Decision

## Decision: Use email and in-system notifications

**Rationale**: Use case mentions email service and CMS notifications; clarified
requirement includes both.

**Alternatives considered**: Email only; in-system only.

## Decision: Editor notification contains only failure notice

**Rationale**: Clarified requirement limits details in failure notification.

**Alternatives considered**: Include author/paper details or error codes.

## Decision: Decision status visible immediately after recording

**Rationale**: Clarified requirement allows authors to view status before
notification delivery.

**Alternatives considered**: Visibility only after delivery.
