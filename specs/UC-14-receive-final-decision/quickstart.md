# Quickstart: Receive Final Paper Decision

## Goal

Validate author notifications, delivery failure logging, and decision status
visibility for UC-14.

## Preconditions

- Final decision is recorded.
- Author has valid contact information.

## Happy Path

1. Trigger notification after decision recording.
2. Confirm author receives email/in-system notification.
3. Verify decision status is visible in the CMS.

## Delivery Failure

- Simulate notification delivery failure and confirm:
  - Failure is logged.
  - Editor is notified.

## View Before Notification

- Access decision status before notification delivery and confirm status is
  visible.
