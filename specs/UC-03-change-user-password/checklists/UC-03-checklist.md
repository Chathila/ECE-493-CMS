# Password Change Quality Checklist: Change User Password

**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for the password change feature.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full password change flow from entry
  point to confirmation and re-login? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-013]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all validation failure scenarios covered by explicit requirements
  (invalid current password, weak new password, mismatch, service outage)?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-004..FR-014]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for authentication service outages and the
  user-facing error response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-014]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is "CMS password policy" referenced or defined with traceable source?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 Is "clear error message" defined with minimum content expectations?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-009..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the re-login requirement described with specific user-facing
  behavior? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories and functional requirements align on re-login
  behavior? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK008 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-014]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows represented with explicit
  requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-014]
- [ ] CHK012 Are invalid current password and mismatch scenarios consistent across
  acceptance scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, §User Story
  3, §FR-004..FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for user abandonment of the change password
  form? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements defined for change password page load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are performance targets for feedback and confirmation timing
  explicitly defined and measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK016 Are security requirements for password handling stated clearly and
  without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about CMS password policy explicit and traceable?
  [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK018 Are assumptions about authentication service availability explicit
  and traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK019 Are vague terms ("clear error message", "meets policy") quantified or
  scoped to avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005, §FR-009]
