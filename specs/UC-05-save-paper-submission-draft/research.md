# Phase 0 Research: Save Paper Submission Draft

## Decision: Partial drafts allowed with minimal required fields

**Rationale**: Drafts are intended to save progress mid-way; requiring all fields
would defeat the use case.

**Alternatives considered**: Full validation or no validation.

## Decision: Minimum required fields are title and corresponding author email

**Rationale**: Provides a minimal identity and contact reference for the draft.

**Alternatives considered**: Require additional metadata fields.

## Decision: No-change saves are allowed

**Rationale**: Authors may click Save to confirm progress; allowing save avoids
confusion.

**Alternatives considered**: Block no-change saves with a warning.
