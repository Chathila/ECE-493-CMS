## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all three user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for validation prior to submission? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for storing reviews on success? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for editor notification on success? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for validation error handling with field-level guidance? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for storage error handling with retry-later messaging? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is the definition of "valid review" clear enough to test? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the scope of editor notifications (no details) explicitly stated? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the retry-later instruction unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK010 Are validation error messages required to list specific fields? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do edge cases align with functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK012 Do assumptions align with the validation and submission requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001..FR-002]
- [ ] CHK013 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with validation and storage error rules? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004..FR-008]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK015 Do success criteria map to requirements (store, notify, validate, retry)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are primary submission flows fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK018 Are validation error flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-004..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK019 Are storage failure flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-008]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are missing/invalid field scenarios explicitly tied to field-level messaging? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-006]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK022 Are response-time expectations specified for submission processing? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK023 Are security or privacy requirements for review content specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK024 Are dependencies on validation service and assignment status documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK025 Are assumptions about invitation acceptance and form completion reflected in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001]
