# Phase 0 Research: Submit Paper Review

## Decision: Validation errors identify specific fields

**Rationale**: Use case requires field-level guidance for completion/correction.

**Alternatives considered**: Generic validation error.

## Decision: Editor notifications include submission only

**Rationale**: Clarified requirement specifies no additional details beyond
submission notice.

**Alternatives considered**: Include scores or full review content.

## Decision: Retry message instructs referee to retry later

**Rationale**: Matches extension guidance without introducing support flow.

**Alternatives considered**: Retry now; contact support.
