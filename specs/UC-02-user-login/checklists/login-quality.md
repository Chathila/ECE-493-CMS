# Login Quality Checklist: User Login

**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for the login feature.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full login flow from entry point to
  authorized home redirect? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all validation failure scenarios covered by explicit requirements
  (missing fields, incorrect credentials, inactive/locked accounts)?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for authentication service outages and the
  user-facing error response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for role-specific access after login?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the term "clear error message" defined with minimum content or
  format expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, §FR-008, §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK006 Is "authorized home page" defined or referenced to a specific
  destination? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the authentication failure message scope clear (e.g., generic vs
  specific to email/password)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do login identifier requirements remain consistent across spec
  sections (email as username)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002a, §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria time thresholds consistent with stated UX
  expectations in user scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK012 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all represented with
  explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK014 Are failure scenarios for incorrect credentials and inactive/locked
  accounts described consistently across scenarios and requirements? [Coverage,
  Spec §User Story 2, §User Story 3, §FR-008..FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements defined for user abandonment of a partially
  completed login form? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for repeated failed login attempts (and
  explicitly note no lockout/throttling)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK017 Are requirements defined for login page load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK018 Are performance targets for validation feedback and redirect timing
  explicitly defined and measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK019 Are security requirements for password handling and non-plaintext
  storage stated clearly and without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK020 Is reliance on the authentication service documented with expected
  behavior during outages? [Dependency, Spec §FR-011, §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK021 Are assumptions about account status and lockout policy explicit and
  traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK022 Are any vague terms ("clear", "authorized", "valid") quantified or
  otherwise scoped to avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006,
  §FR-007, §FR-008]
