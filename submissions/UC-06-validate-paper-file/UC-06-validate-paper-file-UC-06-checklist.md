# File Validation Quality Checklist: Validate Paper File Format and Size

**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for file validation.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full validation flow from upload to
  proceed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all validation failure scenarios covered by explicit requirements
  (unsupported format, oversized file, corrupted file, upload failure)?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Are supported formats explicitly listed or referenced to policy?
  [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the maximum file size explicitly stated or referenced to policy?
  [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK005 Are error messages defined with minimum content expectations?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-003..FR-005, §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 Do user stories and requirements align on corrupted file handling?
  [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK007 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows represented with explicit
  requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for validation service unavailability?
  [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements defined for upload cancelation mid-way?
  [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK013 Are assumptions about file format and size policy explicit and
  traceable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK014 Are vague terms ("clear error message") scoped to avoid subjective
  interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003..FR-005]
