- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for logging delivery failures and notifying the editor? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004..FR-005, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the notification channel requirement explicit (email + in-system)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK006 Is editor failure notification content explicitly constrained? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the timing of CMS decision visibility unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do edge cases align with functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK009 Do assumptions align with notification sequencing requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001..FR-002]
- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with delivery failure handling and status visibility rules? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004..FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK012 Do success criteria map to requirements (notify, log, view status)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003, Spec §FR-001..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are primary notification flows fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK015 Are delivery failure flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-004..FR-005, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK016 Are pre-notification viewing flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK018 Are missing/invalid author contact info scenarios addressed or explicitly out of scope? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK019 Are response-time expectations specified for notification delivery? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK020 Are security/privacy requirements for decision notifications specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK021 Are dependencies on decision recording and notification services documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK022 Are assumptions about author contact validity reflected in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
