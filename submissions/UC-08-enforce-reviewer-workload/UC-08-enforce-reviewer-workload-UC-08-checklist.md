# Reviewer Workload Quality Checklist: Enforce Reviewer Workload Limit

**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for workload limit enforcement.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for workload retrieval, validation, and
  assignment outcomes? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK002 Are failure scenarios covered (limit reached, retrieval failure)?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is the workload limit value explicit and configurable? [Clarity, Spec
  §Clarifications, §FR-002..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are error messages defined with minimum content expectations?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-005..FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do user stories and requirements align on blocking assignments when
  workload data is missing? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3, §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows represented with explicit
  requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements defined for changes in workload limit configuration?
  [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for missing workload count? [Coverage, Spec
  §Clarifications, §FR-006]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK012 Are assumptions about workload limit policy explicit and traceable?
  [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK013 Are vague terms ("clear error message") scoped to avoid subjective
  interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005..FR-007]
