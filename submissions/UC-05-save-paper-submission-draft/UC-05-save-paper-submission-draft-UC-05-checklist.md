**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for draft saving.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full draft save flow from Save
  action to confirmation message? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 Are validation failure scenarios covered by explicit requirements
  (invalid/incomplete draft data)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Are storage error scenarios covered by explicit requirements?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK004 Are no-change save behaviors covered explicitly? [Completeness, Spec
  §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Are minimum required fields for draft saves explicitly stated?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-002a]
- [ ] CHK006 Are "draft validation rules" defined or referenced to a policy?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK007 Are error messages defined with minimum content expectations?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-005..FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do user stories and requirements align on partial draft allowance?
  [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK009 Do edge case statements align with functional requirements without
  contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows represented with explicit
  requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 Are invalid draft data scenarios consistent across acceptance
  scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, §FR-002..FR-005]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements defined for saving without changes? [Coverage, Spec
  §Edge Cases, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements defined for submission form load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for partial draft validation? [Coverage,
  Spec §Clarifications, §FR-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about draft validation policy explicit and traceable?
  [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are vague terms ("valid draft data", "clear error message") scoped to
  avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002, §FR-005]
