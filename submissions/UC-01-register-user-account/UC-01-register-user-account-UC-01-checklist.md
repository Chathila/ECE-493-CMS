**Purpose**: Validate security and UX requirements quality for the registration
feature.
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on
feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for the full registration flow from entry
  point to login redirect? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all validation failure scenarios covered by explicit requirements
  (missing fields, invalid email, duplicate email, weak password)? [Completeness,
  Spec §FR-003..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for email validation service outages and the
  user-facing error response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for confirmation messaging upon success?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for account activation timing and login
  eligibility? [Completeness, Spec §FR-013]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "password security requirements" anchored to a defined CMS policy
  source or reference? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the term "clear error message" defined with minimum content or
  format expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "confirmation message" defined with required content or placement?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "valid email format" defined or referenced to a specific standard?
  [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do the login identifier requirements remain consistent between the
  registration flow and subsequent login behavior (email as username)?
  [Consistency, Spec §FR-005a]
- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria time thresholds consistent with any stated UX
  expectations in user scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK012 Do the error handling requirements align with the listed edge cases
  without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-011, §FR-014]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation details?
  [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK014 Are success criteria linked to user-visible outcomes rather than
  system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all represented with
  explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-014]
- [ ] CHK016 Are failure scenarios for duplicate email and weak password described
  consistently across scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3,
  §FR-005..FR-006]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are requirements defined for user abandonment of a partially completed
  registration form? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements defined for repeated rapid submissions of the
  registration form (and explicitly note no rate limiting)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge
  Cases]
- [ ] CHK019 Are requirements defined for registration page load failures or
  unavailability? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 Are performance targets for validation feedback and redirect timing
  explicitly defined and measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK021 Are security requirements for password handling and non-plaintext
  storage stated clearly and without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK022 Is reliance on the email validation service documented with expected
  behavior during outages? [Dependency, Spec §FR-014, §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK023 Are assumptions about CMS password policy explicit and traceable?
  [Assumption, Spec §FR-006, §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK024 Are any vague terms ("clear", "valid", "meets policy") quantified or
  otherwise scoped to avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004,
  §FR-006, §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK025 Is the absence of rate limiting explicitly stated as an intentional
  choice in requirements? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases]
