**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and consistency of UC-15 requirements for QA review
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Feature**: /Users/chathilaratnatilake/Documents/University/WINTER 2026/ECE 493/ECE-493-CMS/specs/UC-15-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all three user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for retrieving accepted papers and scheduling data? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for algorithm application and schedule generation? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for schedule storage and administrator display? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004..FR-005, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for missing data errors with details? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for algorithm failure errors and logging? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is the definition of "valid schedule" explicit and testable? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the missing-data error content specific to rooms/time slots? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the schedule visibility limitation to the requesting administrator explicit? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do edge cases align with functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-006..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK011 Do assumptions align with requirements for data availability? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with missing-data and failure handling? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-006..FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria map to requirements (generate, store, error handling)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003, Spec §FR-001..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary generation flows fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK017 Are missing-data flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK018 Are algorithm failure flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 Are response-time expectations specified for schedule generation? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK021 Are scheduling fairness or optimization criteria explicitly excluded or defined? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK022 Are dependencies on scheduling data sources documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK023 Are assumptions about algorithm availability documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
