- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for reviews-incomplete errors with placement? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK007 Are requirements defined for database error handling and retry guidance? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK011 Is the retry-later instruction unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do edge cases align with functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-006..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK013 Do assumptions align with review-complete validation requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with error handling and notification rules? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-006..FR-010]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]
- [ ] CHK016 Do success criteria map to requirements (record, notify, error handling)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-003, Spec §FR-004..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary decision flows fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK019 Are reviews-incomplete flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-006..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK020 Are database error flows covered in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are notification-failure scenarios explicitly addressed or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 Are response-time expectations specified for decision submission? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK024 Are security or privacy requirements for decision access specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK025 Are dependencies on review completeness and review-period closure documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK026 Are assumptions about editor authentication reflected in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
