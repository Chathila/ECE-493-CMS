**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all three user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for both Accept and Reject responses? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for assignment status updates after response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for editor notifications after response? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for expired invitations at open time and submit time? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the trigger for showing paper details and response options unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "accept/reject decision only" clearly scoped for editor notifications? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "expired invitation" defined with a clear system behavior at open time? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "database error" handling explicitly described without vague wording? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do edge cases match the functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK011 Do assumptions align with the response-locking requirement? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with the response-locking rule? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria map directly to requirements (response record, status update, notification, error handling)? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004, Spec §FR-003..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary flows (accept/reject) fully covered by requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-004]
- [ ] CHK017 Are notification flows covered and consistent with the requirement to include decision only? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-005..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK018 Are error flows (expired invitation, DB error) covered in both scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-007..FR-010]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are edge cases written as explicit requirements or measurable outcomes, not just questions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are duplicate or repeat-response scenarios addressed explicitly in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-009]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are response handling timeliness or performance expectations specified anywhere? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK022 Are security or validation requirements for invitation access specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are invitation expiry rules explicitly referenced and their source documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 Are dependencies on assignment status definitions documented or referenced? [Gap]
