**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all primary outcomes in the three user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for both successful send and failure recording flows? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements specified for duplicate invitation suppression behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for invalid email handling, including editor notification? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK005 Are failure reasons captured as required data in requirements or data model? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the trigger event for invitation generation unambiguous and tied to the editor assignment action? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK007 Are the required invitation contents explicitly listed without vague wording? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "delivery failure" defined clearly enough to distinguish it from "invalid email"? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "duplicate invitation" scoped to a specific referee-paper assignment? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Are the edge cases consistent with the functional requirements (no contradictions)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK011 Do assumptions align with clarified decisions (no automatic retries)? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK012 Are notification requirements for editor consistent across failure and invalid email scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are all success criteria measurable and time-bound where applicable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria map directly to the stated functional requirements? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria free of implementation details? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary, failure, and audit scenarios each represented in user stories? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1..3]
- [ ] CHK017 Are alternative flows for invalid email and service outage represented in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-006, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK018 Are duplicate assignment scenarios addressed beyond a single edge case entry? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-010]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are all listed edge cases translated into explicit requirements or measurable outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004..FR-010, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK020 Is the email service outage scenario defined with required system response and notifications? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are performance targets for sending and notifying stated and measurable? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK022 Are reliability expectations for recording failures explicitly stated? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are dependencies on assignment confirmation and paper metadata availability captured and justified? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 Are any external email service assumptions explicitly stated or marked as gaps? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
